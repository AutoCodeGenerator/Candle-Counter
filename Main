//The common solution to this problem was to use a loop to manually go through the candle burning logic.
//It is much more efficient to use an algorythm which has a constant time complexity rather than the linear complexity
//that a loop creates.

//Overview: 
    //The idea is that a certain number of burned candles can be recycled into new candles to be burned again. 
    //The output gives the number of candles burned given a certain starting number and the number of used 
    //candles required to make a new one.

int candles(int candlesNumber, int makeNew) {
    return candlesNumber +((candlesNumber-1)/(makeNew-1));
}
